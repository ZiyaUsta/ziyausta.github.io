I hold a PhD and a MSc in Geomatic Engineering ([Karadeniz Technical University](https://www.ktu.edu.tr/en), Turkey), and a BSc in Geodesy and Photogrammetry Engineering ([Yıldız Technical University](https://www.yildiz.edu.tr/en), Turkey). 

I worked with [Prof. Dr. Çetin Cömert](https://www.cetincomert.com) during PhD. 

Currently, I am working as a researcher for the [Department of Geomatics Engineering](https://harita.artvin.edu.tr/) of [Artvin Coruh University](https://www.artvin.edu.tr), Turkey. Also, I worked as a research assistant from June 2012 to June 2021 at the [Department of Geomatic Engineering](https://www.ktu.edu.tr/harita) in Karadeniz Technical University, Turkey. 
 
My main research interest includes combining fields of 3D GIS, Computational Geometry, Computer Graphics and Semantic Web Technologies. I am currently working on web-based management of large-scale 3D geospatial data,quality assesment and healing of 3D geospatial data and semantic web.
I am paricularly a fun of two things open-source and open standards. I always try to use open-source components and open standards in my implementations. 

In work, I use as a text editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) as an IDE. I use Python while developing software prototypes and Rust when the things get serious. As computer, I use Macbooks since 2018 and definitely never ever want to use windows again. For my lectures and labs [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) is my everyday GIS software and for my presentations I use [Emaze](https://www.emaze.com/)

I am also founder of the spin off company for developing 3D GIS applications called "Halo Software".
